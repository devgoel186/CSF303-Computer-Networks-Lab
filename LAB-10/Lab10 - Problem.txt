Write TCP client and server chat application.

There are two clients and a server in the application. The two clients communicate with each other via the server. When one client sends a message to the server, the server stores the message as a text file in the server, where file name is clientid_timestamp.txt. The server then sends the file to the other client that reads the file and displays its content on its terminal. 

The server, as a command line argument, accepts the binding port number. 
The two clients accept the server’s IP address and port number as command line arguments. 
After connecting to the server, each of the clients keeps on reading a line from the standard input and sends it to the server. 
The server writes every new line it receives from the client in a new text file. It then sends the text file to the other client. It displays “MESSAGE SENT TO <IP ADDRESS>:<PORT NO>” on its terminal. Replace <IP ADDRESS>  and <PORT NUMBER> with actual values.
The client, on receiving a text file, reads the content and displays the content on the terminal. 
Both clients exit when either client sends “EXIT” from the terminal.
